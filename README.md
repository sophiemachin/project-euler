# project-euler

Documenting my attempts at the coding challenges on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Source files for problems 1 - 7 are written in C++. The compiled executables are in /executables

To run an executable, open a command prompt and type, for exmaple

   `./euler1`

The answer will be printed in the console.
